Can't believe it's week 11 already. It has been quite a journey. 

In this blogpost, I'll be talking about what learnt from an Informal chat I had with a Google Software Engineer and my open source journey after my Outreachy Internship ( summarized ), That wouldn't have been possible without the help of my mentors.

## Informal Chat With Google Engineer Summary
The key takeaway is ``Keep refining your skills, Don't let self doubt cripple down your potentials and it doesn't hurt applying to big companies like Google, etc.. If I can make it, you too can make it. ``

## After Outreachy Internship
I'll be a co-mentor at ODK-X during the Outreachy Internship programs and also contribute to other Open Source projects, Continue to preach the good news of Open Source. Continue to refine my dev skills to the max and make the world a better place, etc...

Thanks for reading my shortest blogspot so far..
