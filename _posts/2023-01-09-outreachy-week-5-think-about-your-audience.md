I'm sure you should be wondering by now what **I'm working on?** what ODK-X is all about? new to ODK-X?, I've got you covered!

The ``ODK-X`` Tool Suite is free and open-source software for collecting, managing, and using data in resource-constrained environments.

In ``ODK-X``, developers and data managers can create data management applications that consist of survey forms as well as Javascript-based apps. These allow you to render a fully customizable user interface to gather, manage, and visualize data on an Android device.

A major goal of these ``ODK-X`` tools was to eliminate the need for any software engineering skills (for example: Java programming, Android software development environment, source code version control systems) when designing data management applications. The skills required to build a data management application range from scripting a form definition in XLSX (similar to constructing ODK Collect forms using XLSX files processed by the XLSForm tool), to simple web programming â€“ modifying boilerplate HTML and JavaScript for custom presentations of the collected data. Advanced web programmers can also easily implement entirely custom web pages.

``ODK-X`` is currently being used around the world by renowned organisations like; **Red Cross, World Mosquito Program, W.H.O**, Just to name a few.


## What I'll Be Working On During This Internship
My overall task for this internship period is effecting a ``Mobile UI Upliftment for the ODK-X`` apps. I'm working in collaboration with my fellow designer intern to get it done. I work on the development-end, Implementing designs and making sure they work properly, etc..

**This project excites me so much because I'm working on improving the ui components and also implementing new features based on user feedback on an app that's been used all around the world to collect data in resource-contrained environments.**

At the moment i'm working on: **Building A Centralized Theming System That Will Be Reused Across All ODK-X Apps And Migrating All Components To Material 3**
