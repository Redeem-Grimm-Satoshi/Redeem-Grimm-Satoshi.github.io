I'm called **Mbah Redeem Anjoh ( @Redeem Grimm )**. I taught myself how to code and design at a very early age meaning I haven't
gone to any software engineering school. The world is digital and anyone can acquire digital skills without seating in a classroom.

I dropped out of school ( University ) to pursue my tech career, goals and dreams full-time. Since then I've been contributing to
opensource projects, personal projects and taking certification exams, etc..  to improve on myself. It hasn't been an easy journey as I have had a lot of persecutions. I'll write a blog post about this soon.

I did apply to Outreachy this year ( my number 4 attempts ) as I've been rejected 3 times in a row. I didn't give up, I became more
tenacious than ever before, And this years Outreachy Dec 2022 to March 2023 internship round I got selected... Hurrayyyyy!!

I'm Interning at [ODK-X](https://odk-x.org/) and currently working on the project `"Custom UI components for ODK-X mobile apps"`


## My Core Values
I do have many values that govern my life but I'll pick up just 3.

## 1. Freedom
I define **Freedom** as you being able to do what you want with your life without fear of judgment or criticism, You being able
to live your life to the fullest without anything holding you down or enslaving you. I value freedom so much, as that's the only way I can unleash my full potentials.

## 2. Health
Health is something most people take for granted. Without good health you won't be able to do the things you love in life, 
You won't be a ble to accomplish your dreams, goals, purpose. Without good health you won't be able to code or design.. 
**Treat Your Health With Respect If You Want To Accomplish Purpose!**

## 3. Purpose

>What is Purpose? It's that one thing ( passion, etc ) wakes you up every morning, It's that one thing that summarizes your entire existence.

Purpose is very essential to everything that has breath. Without purpose you're useless. Every one of us have a purpose and that's
the reason why we are here on Earth. Living a purpose driven life is what I consider a key priority.

## Why Outreachy?

A year back, A friend recommended Outreachy to me, that's how I got to know about Outreachy.

**What is Outreachy?**

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) provides **internships in open source and open science**. Outreachy provides internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living.

**Now, why did I chose Outreachy?**

- [x]  It's Open source
- [x]  It's diverse
- [x]  It's paid
- [x]  It's remote
- [x]  It has one of my values ( Freedom )

And to add, The project I'm working on has my stack which is Java, UI/UX, Android Dev ðŸ¤—
and I believe Outreachy is the platform that is going to sky rocket my career to the next level!
